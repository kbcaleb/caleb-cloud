This is the quickest way to do a quick CPU test. Just download the latest kernel source and run.
```shell
make oldmenuconfig
```
Just hit enter for all then make a shell script like this.
```shell
#!/bin/bash
make dep
while [ "foo" = "foo" ]
do
	make clean
	make -j2 bzImage
	if [ $? -ne 0 ]
	then
		echo OUCH OUCH OUCH OUCH
		exit 1
	fi
done
```
Just replace -j2 with -j and the +1 of the number of CPUs on the system.<br />
Example:
```shell
Dual Core = -j3
Single = -j2
```
